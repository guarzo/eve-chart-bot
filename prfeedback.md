## 🏗️ Code Architecture & Structure

### 1. Refactor KillRepository.ingestKillmail Method ✅ COMPLETED
**File:** `bot/src/infrastructure/repositories/KillRepository.ts:14-156`  
**Issue:** The `ingestKillmail` method is 142 lines long and handles multiple responsibilities within a single transaction, violating the Single Responsibility Principle.

**Current Problems:**
- Handles kill fact upserting, victim data management, attacker processing, character relationships, and loss fact creation in one method
- Makes testing and maintenance difficult
- Transaction logic is mixed with business logic

**✅ Implementation Completed:**
- Extracted `ingestKillmail` method into 5 focused helper methods:
  - `upsertKillFacts()` - Handles kill fact upserting
  - `processVictimData()` - Manages victim data creation
  - `processAttackerData()` - Processes attackers with `Promise.all()` for performance
  - `manageCharacterRelationships()` - Handles character relationship tracking
  - `createLossFact()` - Creates loss facts for tracked victims
- Main transaction logic is now clean and readable
- Performance improved with parallel attacker processing

### 2. Fix Placeholder Methods in KillRepository ✅ COMPLETED
**File:** `bot/src/infrastructure/repositories/KillRepository.ts:277-317`  
**Issue:** Placeholder methods return empty results without indication, potentially confusing developers and users.

**Problems:**
- Methods like `getTopKillers()`, `getKillsInDateRange()` return empty arrays silently
- No logging to indicate unimplemented functionality
- Redundant type annotations on `_limit` parameters

**✅ Implementation Completed:**
- Added warning logs to all placeholder methods: `logger.warn('Method not yet implemented: getTopKillers')`
- Removed redundant type annotations on `_limit` parameters (TypeScript infers from default values)
- Fixed 6 placeholder methods: `getTopShipTypesUsed`, `getTopEnemyCorporations`, `getDistributionData`, `getKillActivityByTimeOfDay`, `getKillsGroupedByTime`, `getTopShipTypesDestroyed`, `getShipTypesOverTime`

### 3. Optimize Attacker Record Creation Performance ✅ COMPLETED
**File:** `bot/src/infrastructure/repositories/KillRepository.ts:74-93`  
**Issue:** Sequential attacker record creation in a loop causes performance bottlenecks for killmails with many attackers.

**Current Approach:**
```typescript
for (const attacker of attackers) {
  await prisma.attacker.create({ data: attacker })
}
```

**✅ Implementation Completed:**
- Replaced sequential `for` loop with `Promise.all()` for parallel execution
- Improved performance for killmails with many attackers
- Implementation included in the `processAttackerData()` helper method

## 📁 Large File Refactoring

### 4. Break Down Massive ChartService.ts ✅ COMPLETED
**File:** `bot/src/services/ChartService.ts` (1,668 lines)  
**Issue:** Violates Single Responsibility Principle with multiple chart generation responsibilities in one massive file.

**Current Architecture Problems:**
- Single class handling kills charts, map activity charts, efficiency charts, etc.
- Difficult to test individual chart types
- High coupling between different chart generation logic
- Performance issues due to large memory footprint

**✅ Implementation Completed:**
Created new modular chart service architecture:
```
services/charts/
├── ChartServiceFactory.ts          # Dependency injection
├── BaseChartService.ts            # Shared functionality
├── interfaces/
│   ├── IChartService.ts
│   ├── IKillsChartService.ts
│   └── IMapActivityChartService.ts
├── implementations/
│   ├── MainChartService.ts         # Coordinates all chart types
│   ├── KillsChartService.ts        # Handles kills chart generation
│   └── MapActivityChartService.ts  # Handles map activity charts
└── index.ts                        # Export management
```

**Benefits Achieved:**
- Separated kills and map activity chart logic into focused services

### 25. Fix Unsafe Relation Loading ✅ COMPLETED
**Current Issue:** Getters throw errors on unloaded relations

**✅ Implementation Completed:**

#### Safe Relation Access Pattern
- **Nullable Getters**: `get attackers(): KillAttacker[] | null` - Returns null when relations not loaded
- **Safe Getters**: `getAttackersSafe(): KillAttacker[]` - Returns empty array when relations not loaded  
- **Required Getters**: `getAttackersRequired(): KillAttacker[]` - Throws with clear error when needed

#### Explicit Load Methods
- **loadAttackers()**: Repository layer method to safely load attacker relations
- **loadVictim()**: Repository layer method to safely load victim relations
- **clearRelations()**: Memory management method to clear loaded relations
- **areRelationsLoaded()**: Check if all relations are loaded

#### Backward Compatibility
- **attackerCount**: Now returns 0 instead of throwing when relations not loaded
- **hasAttackers/hasVictim**: Safe boolean checks for relation presence
- **actualSolo**: Falls back to solo field when attackers not loaded

#### Key Changes in KillFact.ts:
- **Before**: `get attackers(): KillAttacker[]` (throws error if not loaded)
- **After**: `get attackers(): KillAttacker[] | null` (returns null if not loaded)
- **Added**: `getAttackersSafe()` for safe access with empty array fallback
- **Added**: `getAttackersRequired()` for explicit throwing when needed
- **Added**: Explicit load methods for repository layer to safely manage relations

#### Benefits:
- **No Runtime Errors**: Eliminates unexpected relation loading errors
- **Better Memory Management**: Explicit relation clearing methods
- **Flexible Access**: Multiple access patterns for different use cases
- **Clear Intent**: Explicit methods show when relations are required vs optional
- **Repository Safety**: Clear separation of concerns for relation loading

model KillFact {
  killmailId    BigInt   @id @map("killmail_id")
  killTime      DateTime @map("kill_time")
  shipTypeId    Int      @map("ship_type_id")
  // All fields now camelCase with @map
}
```

#### MapClient → WandererMapClient

- BigInt Standardization: Created comprehensive BigIntTransformer with 37 test cases

### 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR NEXT DEVELOPER

#### Testing Insights
1. **Domain Entity Structure:**
   - Character and CharacterGroup use class-transformer decorators (@Expose, @Transform)
   - KillFact and LossFact extend BaseEntity and use BigInt for IDs
   - MapActivity has custom validation in constructor
   - BaseEntity provides label management and toJSON/toObject methods

2. **Common Testing Gotchas:**
   - BigInt values serialize to strings in JSON (e.g., 12345n becomes "12345")
   - Computed properties (getters) are NOT included in toJSON() output
   - Character.isMain is a getter, not serialized
   - KillVictim.isNpc checks for `=== null`, not undefined
   - validateRequired() doesn't properly handle BigInt 0n (treats it as falsy)

3. **Test Patterns Used:**
   - Used plainToClass/instanceToPlain for class-transformer entities
   - Documented "current behavior" for validation edge cases
   - Separated instance properties from serialized output testing

#### Next Priority Items
1. **Chart Generation Performance (#12)** - Critical for large datasets
   - Current implementation blocks event loop
   - Need worker threads for heavy processing
   - Redis caching needs improvement
   
2. **Service Layer Tests** - Would significantly boost coverage
   - ChartService has complex logic that needs mocking
   - WebSocketIngestionService has some tests but needs expansion
   - CharacterService needs full test coverage

3. **Repository Tests** - Database interaction testing
   - KillRepository has complex transaction logic
   - Need to mock Prisma client properly
   - Test both success and error scenarios

#### Helpful Commands
```bash
# Run specific test file
npm test -- tests/unit/domain/KillFact.test.ts

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test by name
npm test -- -t "should create a kill fact instance"

# Watch mode for development
npm test -- --watch
```

#### Current Test Structure
```

├── setup.ts                    # Jest setup file
├── unit/
│   ├── domain/                 # ✅ COMPLETE (6 files, 169 tests)

│   └── utils/                 # Good coverage
└── integration/               # Needs more tests
```

#### Known Issues
1. Some validation functions don't handle edge cases properly (0n, undefined)
2. Type assertions with `as any` used in tests for invalid input testing
3. Some async operations in services need better error handling tests
