## 🏗️ Code Architecture & Structure

### 1. Refactor KillRepository.ingestKillmail Method ✅ COMPLETED
**File:** `bot/src/infrastructure/repositories/KillRepository.ts:14-156`  
**Issue:** The `ingestKillmail` method is 142 lines long and handles multiple responsibilities within a single transaction, violating the Single Responsibility Principle.

**Current Problems:**
- Handles kill fact upserting, victim data management, attacker processing, character relationships, and loss fact creation in one method
- Makes testing and maintenance difficult
- Transaction logic is mixed with business logic

**✅ Implementation Completed:**
- Extracted `ingestKillmail` method into 5 focused helper methods:
  - `upsertKillFacts()` - Handles kill fact upserting
  - `processVictimData()` - Manages victim data creation
  - `processAttackerData()` - Processes attackers with `Promise.all()` for performance
  - `manageCharacterRelationships()` - Handles character relationship tracking
  - `createLossFact()` - Creates loss facts for tracked victims
- Main transaction logic is now clean and readable
- Performance improved with parallel attacker processing

### 2. Fix Placeholder Methods in KillRepository ✅ COMPLETED
**File:** `bot/src/infrastructure/repositories/KillRepository.ts:277-317`  
**Issue:** Placeholder methods return empty results without indication, potentially confusing developers and users.

**Problems:**
- Methods like `getTopKillers()`, `getKillsInDateRange()` return empty arrays silently
- No logging to indicate unimplemented functionality
- Redundant type annotations on `_limit` parameters

**✅ Implementation Completed:**
- Added warning logs to all placeholder methods: `logger.warn('Method not yet implemented: getTopKillers')`
- Removed redundant type annotations on `_limit` parameters (TypeScript infers from default values)
- Fixed 6 placeholder methods: `getTopShipTypesUsed`, `getTopEnemyCorporations`, `getDistributionData`, `getKillActivityByTimeOfDay`, `getKillsGroupedByTime`, `getTopShipTypesDestroyed`, `getShipTypesOverTime`

### 3. Optimize Attacker Record Creation Performance ✅ COMPLETED
**File:** `bot/src/infrastructure/repositories/KillRepository.ts:74-93`  
**Issue:** Sequential attacker record creation in a loop causes performance bottlenecks for killmails with many attackers.

**Current Approach:**
```typescript
for (const attacker of attackers) {
  await prisma.attacker.create({ data: attacker })
}
```

**✅ Implementation Completed:**
- Replaced sequential `for` loop with `Promise.all()` for parallel execution
- Improved performance for killmails with many attackers
- Implementation included in the `processAttackerData()` helper method

## 📁 Large File Refactoring

### 4. Break Down Massive ChartService.ts ✅ COMPLETED
**File:** `bot/src/services/ChartService.ts` (1,668 lines)  
**Issue:** Violates Single Responsibility Principle with multiple chart generation responsibilities in one massive file.

**Current Architecture Problems:**
- Single class handling kills charts, map activity charts, efficiency charts, etc.
- Difficult to test individual chart types
- High coupling between different chart generation logic
- Performance issues due to large memory footprint

**✅ Implementation Completed:**
Created new modular chart service architecture:
```
services/charts/
├── ChartServiceFactory.ts          # Dependency injection
├── BaseChartService.ts            # Shared functionality
├── interfaces/
│   ├── IChartService.ts
│   ├── IKillsChartService.ts
│   └── IMapActivityChartService.ts
├── implementations/
│   ├── MainChartService.ts         # Coordinates all chart types
│   ├── KillsChartService.ts        # Handles kills chart generation
│   └── MapActivityChartService.ts  # Handles map activity charts
└── index.ts                        # Export management
```

**Benefits Achieved:**
- Separated kills and map activity chart logic into focused services
- Introduced dependency injection via ChartServiceFactory
- Created clear interfaces for each service type
- Extracted shared functionality into BaseChartService
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing chart generation
- Reduced complexity from 1,668 lines to manageable service classes
