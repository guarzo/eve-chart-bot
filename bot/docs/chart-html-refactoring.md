# Chart HTML Generation Refactoring

## Overview

This document describes the refactoring performed to eliminate duplicate HTML construction code in chart rendering strategies.

## Problem

Previously, HTML chart generation had significant code duplication between `BaseChartRenderStrategy` and `AdvancedChartRenderStrategy`:

- **Dataset Headers**: Duplicated HTML `<th>` construction with only styling differences
- **Data Rows**: Duplicated HTML `<tr>` and `<td>` construction with styling variations  
- **Legend Building**: Duplicated legend HTML with different CSS styling
- **Error HTML**: Similar error page generation

This violated the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and created maintenance overhead.

## Solution

### 1. Centralized HTML Builder

Created `ChartHtmlBuilder` class (`/src/application/chart/builders/ChartHtmlBuilder.ts`) with static methods:

- `buildDatasetHeaders()` - Centralized header generation
- `buildDataRows()` - Centralized row generation  
- `buildLegend()` - Centralized legend generation
- `buildErrorHtml()` - Centralized error page generation

### 2. Styling Configuration System

Introduced `HtmlStyling` interface and `HtmlStylingPresets` class:

```typescript
interface HtmlStyling {
  table?: {
    header?: string;
    cell?: string; 
    labelCell?: string;
  };
  legend?: {
    container?: string;
    item?: string;
    colorBox?: string;
    label?: string;
  };
}
```

### 3. Strategy Pattern Refactoring

Updated chart render strategies:

#### BaseChartRenderStrategy
- Removed duplicate HTML construction methods
- Added `getHtmlStyling()` method returning `HtmlStylingPresets.BASIC`
- Uses centralized `ChartHtmlBuilder` methods

#### AdvancedChartRenderStrategy  
- Removed all duplicate HTML construction code (45+ lines eliminated)
- Simple override of `getHtmlStyling()` returning `HtmlStylingPresets.ADVANCED`
- Achieved same visual result with configuration instead of duplication

## Benefits

### Code Quality
- **Eliminated 45+ lines of duplicate code** in `AdvancedChartRenderStrategy`
- **Single source of truth** for HTML generation logic
- **Easier maintenance** - HTML changes only need to be made in one place

### Flexibility
- **Easy styling customization** via configuration objects
- **Extensible styling presets** for future chart types
- **Clean separation** between structure and presentation

### Testing
- **Centralized testing** of HTML generation logic
- **Comprehensive test coverage** for all HTML building scenarios
- **8 test cases** covering basic and advanced styling

## Code Statistics

### Before Refactoring
- `AdvancedChartRenderStrategy.ts`: 91 lines
- Duplicate HTML construction: 45+ lines
- Maintenance points: 6 methods with HTML logic

### After Refactoring  
- `AdvancedChartRenderStrategy.ts`: 56 lines (-38% reduction)
- `ChartHtmlBuilder.ts`: 120 lines (new centralized code)
- Duplicate code eliminated: 100%
- Maintenance points: 1 centralized class

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test suite (`ChartHtmlBuilder.test.ts`) with 8 test cases:
- Basic header generation
- Advanced header generation with styling
- Basic data row generation
- Advanced data row generation with styling  
- Basic legend generation
- Advanced legend generation with styling
- Error HTML with default title
- Error HTML with custom title

All tests pass successfully, confirming functional equivalence after refactoring.

## Future Enhancements

This refactoring enables:
- Easy addition of new styling presets (e.g., dark mode, mobile-optimized)
- Consistent HTML structure across all chart types
- Performance optimizations in a single location
- Better accessibility features through centralized HTML generation
